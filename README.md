- 👀 For now, I’m interested in NLP, and these are the places where my recently research lays.
- 🏫 I’m currently a senior student majoring in CS at Fudan University, China.
- 🤗 I love sports like hiking, yoga, loping, tennis, gym working, swimming and so on. Plus, I am a big fan of movies and books. I'm totally obsessed with the Lord of the Rings and the other tales about the Middle Earth in Tolkein's book. I'd be quite thrilled if we share the common taste!
